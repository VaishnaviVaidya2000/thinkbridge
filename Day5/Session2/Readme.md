Create a Single Repo called thinkbridge.. Move all the work you have created repos for to this one repo in this folder structure. It should look like this.
 
thinkbridge
      day1
session1
session2 
session3 
session4
day2
session1
session2
session3
sesssion4 
and so forth..
Invite "sganesh1975" to this repo. 
REVOKE the permission for "sganesh1975" on the old shares from the previous days.
 
After you have moved the work so far in this fashion, goto the web application Harmony Engine and sign yourself up. 
Then create a project with your name. My would be "Sai Ganesh". Add a collaborator "sai@thinkbridge.com". 
Then connect the github and pick the thinkbridge repository for the codebase to be processed. 
Connect the project to the github repository for it to process the codebase.
