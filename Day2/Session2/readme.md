Created repository Repo 'web-playground' with initial commits and .gitignore.
Initialize repo, stage/commit changes, write meaningful commit messages.
Create .gitignore; practice git log, diff, restore.
Configure user.name and user.email; set default branch to main.
Commit convention added to README (e.g., Conventional Commits link).
